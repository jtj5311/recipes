--------------------- 

Ingredients:
2 lb Yellow Potatoes
1/4 tsp Baking Soda
1/3 cup Canola Oil
Kosher Salt & Pepper

---------------------------

Guide:
1: Preheat oven to 425 F.
2: Pour oil into the bottom of a roasting pan, making sure that the bottom is completely covered. Place the pan in the preheated oven to heat while you parboil the potatoes.
3: Peel your potatoes then cut in half and put in a pot of cold, salted water with baking soda. Bring water to a full rolling boil over high heat and boil for approximately 5 minutes.
4: After 5 minutes, drain the potatoes in a colander and then add back to the pot. Cover the pot with a lid and give the parboiled potatoes a good shake. The goal here is to smash the potatoes up a bit as all the jagged edges and fluff are what will get extra crispy in the oven.
5: Take the preheated pan out of the oven and add the roughed up potatoes. You should immediately hear a sizzle.
6: Mix the potatoes in the hot oil and then put back in the oven to roast at 425 F for approximately 40 to 50 minutes, or until the potatoes are crispy and a deep golden brown. Give them a stir and a shake every 15 minutes so so to ensure an even roast.
7: Once they are a deep golden brown remove the pan from the oven. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the potatoes to a paper towel lined plate and generously season with salt and pepper while they are still piping hot. Serve immediately and enjoy!
