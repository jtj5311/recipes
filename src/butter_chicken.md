14- ounce Canned Tomatoes
5-6 cloves Garlic
1-2 teaspoons Minced Ginger
1 teaspoon Turmeric
1/2 teaspoons Cayenne Pepper
1 teaspoon Smoked Paprika
1 teaspoon Kosher Salt
1 teaspoon Garam Masala
1 teaspoon Ground Cumin
1 pound Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs, (or use breast, bone-in, or whatever works for you. If frozen, add 1-2 minutes to total time)

4 ounces Heavy Cream, (use full-fat coconut milk if dairy free)
1 teaspoon Garam Masala
1/4-1/2 cup chopped cilantro

---------------------------

Guide
1: Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce a bit so it defrosts better
2: Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure. 
3: Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
4: Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
5: Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
6: Let sauce cool slightly
7: Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you need but don't shred it.
8: Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles
